# [WIP] Useful runelite plugins for Tombs of Amascut
My personal collection of runelite plugins I use for ToA on oldschool runescape. If you can't find any of them on your plugin list, you need to download it using the plugin hub. Credits to all the plugin makers over there, I'm just listing some here.
## Annoyance Mute
Mutes the Armadyl crossbow special attack sound.

## Custom Menu Swaps
Currently using it for an entry swap on Akkha. This prioritizes the attack on the shadow instead of the real Akkha.
Put this on Custom swaps: `attack,akkha's shadow*`

Also useful for the Bank swaps, making it easy to eat/wield stuff without closing the bank interface.

## Ground Markers
This allows you to mark tiles on the ground. I have separated the marks I use on another files:
xx.md
yy.md
 ## Inventory Setups
 Useful for making setup templates, with the option to bank filter based on the selected template. Saves some time while banking and I like it more than bank tabs.

## Inventory Tags
ToA is all about tribiding. If you are not very familiar with it, or just wanna make it easier, this plugins allows you to highlight inventory items with specific colors. I personally use it with red for melee, blue for magic and green for ranged items.

## Menu Entry Swapper
Very useful for the "Shift click Walk here" on a lot of ToA rooms. I personally activate the shift click option on every menu, so that I can hold shift and walk anywhere without missclicking boulders or any other thing. You can also change the left click and shift left click on specific items, such as:
- Supplies
Left click: Withdraw-all
Shift left click: Resupply
- Neutralising Potion (Ba-ba puzzle room)
Left click: Pour
Shift left click: Use (useful for duos, since you can shift left click it and click on your duo to use the potion on him)

## Monster HP Percentage
Shows the HP percentage of specific monsters. Very useful in ToA since specific HP % triggers special bosses attacks. NPC Names: `Ba-ba,akkha,kephri,zebak,tumeken's warden`
